# Crop Recommendation Model ðŸŒ±

## Overview
The **Crop Recommendation Model** leverages machine learning to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crops for their land. By analyzing environmental and soil conditions, the model provides recommendations on which crops will thrive best, optimizing yield and resource use. It aims to enhance agricultural productivity and promote sustainable farming practices.

## Features
- **Predictive Crop Selection**: Suggests optimal crops based on environmental and soil data.
- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Uses historical data and machine learning to predict high-yielding crops.
- **Sustainability Focus**: Aims to reduce resource waste by recommending crops suited to the specific conditions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies complex agricultural data into actionable insights for farmers.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning Algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors)
- Pandas, Numpy (Data Handling)
- Scikit-learn (Modeling & Evaluation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

## Installation
To get started with the **Crop Recommendation Model**, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vikrant0306/crop-recommendation-model.git
   cd crop-recommendation-model
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the model:
   ```bash
   python crop_recommendation.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Input Data**: The model requires environmental and soil data (e.g., temperature, humidity, soil type). Input this data via CSV files or as real-time inputs.
2. **Prediction**: Once the data is provided, the model will predict and suggest the most suitable crops based on the input features.
3. **Output**: The model will output crop suggestions along with key recommendations for each crop based on the given conditions.

## Example
```python
# Example usage in Python
from crop_recommendation import recommend_crop

input_data = {
    'temperature': 25,  # in Celsius
    'humidity': 70,  # in percentage
    'soil_type': 'loamy',
}

recommended_crop = recommend_crop(input_data)
print(f"Recommended Crop: {recommended_crop}")
```
